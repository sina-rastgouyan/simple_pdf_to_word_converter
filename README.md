# simple_pdf_to_word_converter
This is just a simple pdf to word converter using pypdf2.
This script just converts a pdf file to a word as simplest as possible so it don't extract details such as font size, font name, etc.
It just extracts text from a pdf file and save the extracted text as a word file.
In this program I used PyPDF2 library and this script is not optimized for pdfs which contain images.

Sincerely,
Sina Rastgouyan
